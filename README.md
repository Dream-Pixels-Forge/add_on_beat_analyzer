  - Bake to Geometry (Audio Value Geometry) for geometry nodes
- ðŸŽ¨ Audio-reactive animations for both Shader and Geometry Nodes
- ðŸŽ¬ Real-time audio visualization
- ðŸŽ­ Independent control over shader and geometry animations
- âš¡ Optimized audio baking system
- ðŸ”§ Customizable smoothing and limits

## Perfect for
- Motion Designers
- Video Editors
- 3D Animators
- Music Video Creators
- Live Visual Artists
- Anyone working with audio-driven animations

## Features in Detail

### Beat Analysis
- Four detection methods:
  - Energy Based (classic)
  - Spectral Flux (frequency-based)
  - Complex Detection (combined)
  - Adaptive Threshold (dynamic)
- Customizable frequency bands
- Noise reduction
- Beat refinement
- BPM detection

### Marker Management
- Automatic beat markers
- Three strength levels (strong, medium, weak)
- Easy navigation between beats
- Camera binding to markers
- Customizable marker visibility

### Audio Visualization
- Bake audio to noise textures
- Use in Geometry Nodes
- Shader node group creation
- Real-time preview
- Smoothing controls

### Motion Design Tools
- Pre-built shader node groups
- Audio-reactive material templates
- Geometry nodes compatibility
- Customizable parameters
- Real-time feedback

### Video Editing Features
- Automatic audio sync
- Timeline markers
- Camera switching
- Export capabilities
- Audio muting control

## Advanced Settings
- Custom frequency ranges
- Sensitivity adjustment
- Noise reduction
- Beat refinement
- Threading options
- Caching system

## Workflow Integration
### For Motion Designers
- Create audio-reactive materials
- Drive parameters with beat intensity
- Automatic keyframe generation
- Real-time visualization feedback

### For Video Editors
- Automatic beat detection
- Easy camera switching
- Timeline organization
- Export capabilities

## Performance Tips
- Enable threading for faster analysis
- Use caching for repeated analysis
- Adjust window size for precision
- Choose appropriate frequency bands

## Technical Requirements
- Blender 3.0 or newer
- Python 3.7+
- Supported audio formats: WAV

## Known Limitations
- WAV format only (convert other formats first)
- Large files may require more processing time
- Real-time preview may affect performance

## Troubleshooting
- If analysis is slow, enable threading
- If beats are missed, adjust sensitivity
- If markers are cluttered, use visibility options
- If performance issues, disable real-time preview
- If your geometry desappear, check groupin and groupout type are geometry or create on by your self

## Updates and Support
- Check for updates regularly
- Report issues on the repository
- Suggest features for future versions
